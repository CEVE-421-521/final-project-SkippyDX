# Introduction

## Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem statement that your chosen feature aims to address.
Explain the significance of this problem in the context of climate risk management.

This project will improve the model's ability to estimate the price to rebuild a home after flooding by accounting for more complex aspects of discount rate and price changes based on scarcity after a flood. 

To obtain a more accurate understanding of cost over time, the discount rate will be broken down to have separate discount rates for the net present value calculation, the housing market, and the cost of labor and materials. Including these values will capture the way that different aspects of cost change over time in different ways; for example, perhaps inflation is higher for labor or materials. These factors will affect estimates of the cost to rebuild a house entirely from scratch. The discount rates, which may have different distributions or be constant, will be decided based on the findings of the literature review. 

Additionally, the model will be modified to capture how scarcity caused by a flood affects construction cost. Including storm surge rating as a way to estimate the severity of the flood's impact of scarcity of materials and labor will enable the model to estimate the cost of rebuilding a house from scratch given scarcity.

The components added to the model are illustrated in Figure 1.

## Selected Feature

Describe the feature you have selected to add to the existing decision-support tool.
Discuss how this feature relates to the problem statement and its potential to improve climate risk assessment.

The two features we've deicded to add are additional discount rates in order to model price increase for construction and labor costs as well as a factor that multiples the cost to rebuild the house after a flood in order to model scarcity after a flood event. This will improve the climate risk assessment as it more accurately shows that magnitude of the costs associated with rebuilding the house. Under our previous model without these changes, we are likely to come to an optimal solution that is lower than what the elevation should actually be in the real world. The increased cost to rebuild in the future makes solutions using a higher elevation in year 1 more robust. 

# Literature Review

Provide a brief overview of the theoretical background related to your chosen feature.
Cite at least two relevant journal articles to support your approach (see [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) for help with citations).
Explain how these articles contribute to the justification of your selected feature.

# Methodology

## Implementation

You should make your modifications in either the `HouseElevation` or `ParkingGarage` module.
Detail the steps taken to implement the selected feature and integrate it into the decision-support tool.
Include code snippets and explanations where necessary to clarify the implementation process.

The scarcity/demand surge feature will be added by assuming a linear relationship between the damage of the house and the demand surge magnitude. The highest value for a demand surge was found to be around 20%. Thus, if a house was damages by 50%, the demand surge will be 50% of 20%, which is 10%. This 10% will then be multiplied onto the damage that the house suffered in order to model how much more it would cost to rebuild under scarcity. For the example before, this would be 50% * (1 + 10%) = 55% damage.

## Validation

As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to misleading results.
To minimize the risk of errors making their way into final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.
Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implemented feature.
Discuss any challenges faced during the validation process and how they were addressed.

# Results

Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.
Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the outcomes.
Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented feature addresses the problem statement.
Use the `#| output: false` and/or `#| echo: false` tags to hide code output and code cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the discussion.
You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can create using `##`.

# Conclusions

## Discussion

Analyze the implications of your results for climate risk management.
Consider the context of the class themes and discuss how your findings contribute to the understanding of climate risk assessment.
Identify any limitations of your approach and suggest potential improvements for future work.

## Conclusions

Summarize the key findings of your project and reiterate the significance of your implemented feature in addressing the problem statement.
Discuss the broader implications of your work for climate risk management and the potential for further research in this area.
